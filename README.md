========
This tool reads out statistics from Huawei GSM/UMTS sticks and sends them to an emonCMS (http://emoncms.org/) host.
This is a command line tool. 
It can be brought into background (via Ctrl-Z, bg), but does not make itself into a daemon - yet.

* **MacOSX**: not yet tried
* **Raspi**: GSM/UMTS traffic data
* **Linux**: not yet tried

* Prerequisites: libconfig9, libconfig-dev
